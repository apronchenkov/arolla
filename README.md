# Arolla

Arolla is a library that allows users to create and manipulate custom
expressions, such as computational graphs, symbolic expressions, or Abstract
Syntax Trees (ASTs). These expressions can be composed, explored and modified in
an interactive Python-powered environment, such as Google Colab, and then easily
loaded in C++.

The library includes an evaluation engine and a rich set of operators to support
the computational applications.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
